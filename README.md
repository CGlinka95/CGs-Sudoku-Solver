# CGs Sudoku Solver

A new project using the Sudoku Solver API from RapidAPI to test my JavaScript skills and create a small application that solves any valid Sudoku puzzle in a matter of seconds. I'd like to do a full react layout for this project with MUI components eventually when I have the time. As of right now it's not very pretty. But it's functional!

## Dependancies

- nodemon 
- parcel
- axios
- cors
- dotenv
- express

Run 'npm install' in the root of the directory to install all dependancies and then run 'npm start' to run the front end dev build. Next run 'npm start:backend' to run the backend server containing the API key to make the application functional.
